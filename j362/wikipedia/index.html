                child. She attended Douglas MacArthur High School in San Antonio from 1984 to 1988. When in high
                school, she became a vegan and started her first animal rights group.

                Ornelas studied at St. Edward's University in Austin from 1990-1993, majoring in communications and

                transitioned into Action for Animals after she graduated.[3] While in college, nuns tore down her
                "Go Veggie" posters.[4] In the 1992-93 academic year, Ornelas was a recipient of the St. Edward's
                University Presidential Award.[5]

                Ornelas received her Bachelor of Arts degree from St. Edward's. She continued her work for animals
                while attending university and eventually became the National Coordinator for In Defense of
