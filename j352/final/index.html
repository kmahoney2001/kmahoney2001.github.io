                <p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Today, viewing art as a student often comes with a price. From
                    attending galleries to simply going
                    to
                    the
                    movies, prices of travel and viewing art seem unfeasible for the average college student. Situated
                    within the
                    walls of the Parren J. Mitchell Art and Sociology building at the University of Maryland lies a
                    solution
                    to the
                    problem of accessing free art, the University of Maryland Art Gallery.</p>

        The University of Maryland Art Gallery began in 1966 with the collection of prints and drawings from Martin
        W.
        Brown. It started out in the Tawes Fine Arts Center and moved into the Art-Sociology Building in 1976. <br>
        <br>
        Throughout the years at the University of Maryland there have been endless exhibits covering all different
        forms
        of art. While the gallery has almost 4500 objects, they often showcase work by outside artists.

                Recent exhibitions include Emilio Sánchez x Lost Sock Roasters exhibit which ran from June 20 to October
                7,
                2022. The University of Maryland worked alongside Lost Sock Roasters from DC to present Cuban artist
                Emilio
                Sánchez. With a focus on architectural prints with pops of bright hues, Sánchez ties in the color
                palette of
                traditional Caribbean architecture to express origins and place.
                <br> <br>
                Earlier in the year, the University of Maryland’s Art Gallery hosted artist Daniela Libertad’s first
                ever
                exhibition on United States soil, Daniela Libertad: Yo regreso a las acciones sencillas. Libertad is a
                Mexico City-born artist residing in Germany. She is a multidisciplinary artist who uses drawings,
                sculptures, photographs and videos. In this exhibit she highlights the connection between body and
                object
                while embodying storytelling traditions
                <br> <br>
                There are also MFA shows to showcase graduate students' work. This includes the one that occurred this
                past spring with Alyssa Imes, Elizabeth Katt and Martin Gonzales.

    <h2> The Virtual . . .</h2>
    <div class="virtual">
        <p>
            With the semester coming to a close, many of the in-person exhibits are ending, including Video in the
            Atrium (VITA): Cristina Lucas, which ends December 30 and Christopher Bartel: The Skinwalker Ranch Portfolio
            which ends December 31 leaving students only a few days left to visit them in-person. However, while many
            students leave before the holidays, the art gallery provides online viewings of some exhibitions while they
            are running. Students are free to leave campus and retreat home with the ability to view current exhibits
            from their hometown.
