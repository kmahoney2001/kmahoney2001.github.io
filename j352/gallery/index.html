            <h2> The Gallery</h2>
            <p> Today, viewing art as a student often comes with a price. From attending galleries to simply going to
                the
                movies, prices of travel and viewing art seem unfeasible for the average college student. Situated
                within the
                walls of the Parren J. Mitchell Art and Sociology building at the University of Maryland lies a solution
                to the
                problem of accessing free art, the University of Maryland Art Gallery.</p>

    <h3> The Past . . .</h3>
    <div class="past">
        <p> The University of Maryland Art Gallery began in 1966 with the collection of prints and drawings from Martin
            W.
            Brown. It started out in the Tawes Fine Arts Center and moved into the Art-Sociology Building in 1976. <br>
            <br>
            Throughout the years at the University of Maryland there have been endless exhibits covering all different
            forms
            of art. While the gallery has almost 4500 objects, they often showcase work by outside artists. </p>

    <h3> The Recent . . .</h3>
    <div class="col-lg-6">
    <img src="/j352/gallery/photos/exhibits.jpg" alt="filler" class="img-fluid">
    <div class="recent">
        <p> Recent exhibitions include Emilio Sánchez x Lost Sock Roasters exhibit which ran from June 20 to October 7,
            2022. The University of Maryland worked alongside Lost Sock Roasters from DC to present Cuban artist Emilio
            Sánchez. With a focus on architectural prints with pops of bright hues, Sánchez ties in the color palette of
            traditional Caribbean architecture to express origins and place.

            Earlier in the year, the University of Maryland’s Art Gallery hosted artist Daniela Libertad’s first ever
            exhibition on United States soil, Daniela Libertad: Yo regreso a las acciones sencillas. Libertad is a
            Mexico City-born artist residing in Germany. She is a multidisciplinary artist who uses drawings,
            sculptures, photographs and videos. In this exhibit she highlights the connection between body and object
            while embodying storytelling traditions</p>
